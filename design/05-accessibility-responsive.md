# Milestone 5: Accessibility, Responsiveness & Performance

This final plan ensures the application is inclusive, works beautifully on all devices, and performs smoothly.

## Tasks

### 1. Conduct Full Keyboard Accessibility Audit
- **Goal:** Ensure every interactive element can be operated with a keyboard.
- **Actions:**
    - Tab through the entire application in a logical order.
    - Verify that all buttons, chips, and form inputs have a clear and consistent focus state (`focus-visible:ring-2...`).
    - Ensure popover editors can be opened, navigated, and closed with keyboard commands (Enter, Esc, Arrow Keys).
    - Confirm that drag-and-drop has a keyboard alternative (e.g., an "Add" button on chips, or arrow keys to reorder).

### 2. Implement ARIA Attributes for Dynamic UI
- **Goal:** Make the application understandable to screen readers.
- **Actions:**
    - For drag-and-drop, use `aria-grabbed`, `aria-dropeffect`, and live regions (`aria-live`) to announce reordering actions.
    - Add `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to icon buttons and other non-descriptive controls.
    - Ensure all form controls in editors have associated labels.
    - Use `aria-hidden` to hide purely decorative elements.

### 3. Verify Color Contrast
- **Goal:** Meet WCAG AA contrast standards in both light and dark modes.
- **Actions:**
    - Use a browser dev tool or online checker to test text contrast on all backgrounds, especially on gradients and colored surfaces.
    - Adjust text colors (`text-white/90`, `text-black/80`) or background opacities as needed to meet the minimum 4.5:1 ratio (3:1 for large text).
    - Pay special attention to disabled or placeholder text.

### 4. Implement Responsive Layouts
- **Goal:** Ensure the app is usable and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Actions:**
    - **Mobile:** Implement the single-column layout. Create a sticky bottom action bar containing the primary actions ("Copy", "Presets") for easy access.
    - **Tablet:** Ensure the two-column layout is effective. Consider making the preview column collapsible to save space.
    - **Touch Devices:** For drag-and-drop, provide a clear alternative, such as an "Add" button on each token chip that appends it to the format list.

### 5. Performance Optimization
- **Goal:** Keep the application lightweight and fast.
- **Actions:**
    - Double-check the Tailwind CSS purge configuration to ensure it's tree-shaking unused styles.
    - If the preview component becomes computationally expensive, investigate lazy-loading it.
    - Analyze the animation implementation to ensure it relies on CSS transforms (`translate`, `scale`) rather than more expensive properties like `box-shadow` on large, moving elements.
    - Audit the final bundle size and identify any unexpectedly large dependencies.

### 6. Final Acceptance Criteria Check
- **Goal:** A final review against the project's main goals.
- **Actions:**
    - The UI feels clean with clear hierarchy and breathing room.
    - Chips are obviously draggable, with delightful but subtle motion.
    - Editors are consistent, accessible, and give immediate feedback.
    - Copy / preset actions provide clear confirmation.
    - Dark mode is first-class and high-contrast.
    - Performance is snappy; animations never feel sluggish.
