# Chip Fixes Plan

This document tracks fixes to the chip editing.

## Tasks
- [] Add example formats (online, short, medium) as text links in 'Build your format section'.
     Pressing on these links pre-populates that format.
- [] Format chips (e.g. colors) should be colored according to their value when displayed in
     the 'Build your format' section.
- [] The component chips including styles should not change. Currently the color of the 'style'
     chip is the last color that was selected, this is wrong.
- [] The 'Formatted string' textbox should be a minimum of 1 line and wrap the current content height.
- [] Pressing on a chip in the 'Build your format' section should allow you to change the type
     e.g. if the chip is currently 'Author: name' pressing on it should reveal the dropdown allowing
    to select other options like 'Author email'.
